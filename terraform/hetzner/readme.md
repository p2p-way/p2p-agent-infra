## [Description](#p2p-agents-on-hetzner)

 This code provides [Terraform](../readme.md) configuration for [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/) stack deployment for P2P content distribution.
 1. [Cloud Server](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/) - VM provisioning.

 Generally, this configuration will do the following

**Agent**
 1. Create servers.


## [Considerations](#p2p-agents-on-hetzner)

 1. Check [Considerations](../readme.md#considerations).


## [Limitations](#p2p-agents-on-hetzner)

 1. Hetzner does not provide Autoscaling or other services to implement a [Watcher](../../architecture.md#watcher) or [Agent side watcher](../../architecture.md#agent-side-watcher) and instances will be started right during applying Terraform configuration.
 2. [Remote backend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/remote) for Terraform is not implemented yet and state will be stored locally.


## [Regions](#p2p-agents-on-hetzner)

 - [Locations](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/general/locations/)
 - [Cloud locations](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud#locations)

   ```shell
   # List locations
   hcloud location list

   # List Datacenters
   hcloud datacenter list

   # Describe a datacenter
   hcloud datacenter describe nbg1-dc3

   # List Server Types
   hcloud server-type list
   ```

## [Costs](#p2p-agents-on-hetzner)

 [Pricing](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud#pricing)

 | Resource                                                                           | Price        | Costs      | Comment           |
 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----------------- |
 | [VPS with AMD EPYCâ„¢ 7002 series processors](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud#pricing) | `0.0146 $/h` | `8.49 $/m` | CPX11 / Singapore |
 | [Primary IPv4](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud#pricing)                              | `0.001 $/h`  | `0.60 $/m` |                   |
 | TOTAL                                                                              |              | `9.09 $/m` |                   |

```
9.09 $/m/i / 31 d = 0.29 $/d/i   # 1 day / 1 instance / 1 region
0.29 $/d/i x  6 r = 1.74 $/d/i/r # 1 day / 1 instance / all regions
```

 Run **1 instance** in **all public regions**, during **1 day**, may cost ~ **1.74 $**

 > [!NOTE]
 > Provided costs are very approximate because we use a highest instance price across all the regions.


## [Requirements](#p2p-agents-on-hetzner)

 In order to proceed with this deployment, we need
 1. Linux host with [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) installed.
 2. Hetzer Cloud [API token](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/api/getting-started/generating-api-token/) with `Read & Write` permissions.


## [Deployment](#p2p-agents-on-hetzner)

 1. Get Terraform code from GitHub repository
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/p2p-way/p2p-agent-infra

    cd p2p-agent-infra/terraform/hetzner
    ```

 2. Select the required regions where to run agents
    ```shell
    mv regions/region-* .
    ```
    Pleasee check [Known issues](#known-issues) for more information about [Regions](#regions).

 3. Configure input data for deployment in *variables.auto.tfvars* file
    ```shell
    vi variables.auto.tfvars
    ```
    For more information, please see [Configuration](../readme.md#configuration).

 4. Authenticate on Hetzner
    ```shell
    export HCLOUD_TOKEN="<api token>"
    ```

 5. Run Terraform
    ```shell
    # Initialize
    terraform init

    # View execution plan
    terraform plan

    # Apply changes
    terraform apply
    ```

 6. Get SSH keys
    ```shell
    # Agent - Private key
    terraform output -raw instance_private_key

    # Agent - Public key
    terraform output -raw instance_public_key

    # Repository - Private key
    terraform output -raw repository_private_key

    # Repository - Public key
    terraform output repository_public_key
    ```

 7. Add value of the `repository_public_key` output to the Git repository
    - GitHub: Repository --> Settings --> Security --> Deploy keys

 After some period of time all resources will be created and nodes will start. After the start, they will connect to the control center and will setup all configuration required to support P2P content distribution.


### [Update configuration](#p2p-agents-on-hetzner)

 After we deployed initial configuration, it maybe required to update nodes capacity or add more regions.

 Update is very transparent and we need just to set `desired_capacity` with the required number and run Terraform.


#### [Update capacity](#p2p-agents-on-hetzner)

 1. Set `desired_capacity` in the *variables.auto.tfvars* globaly, or set it per region in the module configuration.
 2. Run `terraform plan`.
 3. Run `terraform apply`.


#### [Add new region](#p2p-agents-on-hetzner)

 1. Add a configuration file for the new region.
 2. Run `terraform init`.
 3. Run `terraform plan`.
 4. Run `terraform apply`.


## [Cleanup](#p2p-agents-on-hetzner)

 In order to cleanup all created resources we should use the following steps
 1. Cleanup resources created by Terraform
    ```shell
    terraform destroy
    ```


## [Known issues](#p2p-agents-on-hetzner)

 1. [Hetzner products availability](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/general/locations/#which-cloud-products-are-available) vary by regions and it might be required to adjust server type to every region.
 2. Default account limit for server resources is low and it might be required to request limit increase - [How many servers can I create?](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/servers/faq/#how-many-servers-can-i-create).
