## [Description](#control-center-on-cloudflare)

 This code provides [Terraform](../readme.md) configuration for [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) stack deployment for P2P content distribution.
 1. [Cloudflare DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/dns/) - Control center DNS name
 2. [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/r2/) - Control center origin
 3. [Cloudflare CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/cdn/) with [Cloudflare Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/) - Control center which will return headers

 Generally, this configuration will do the following

**Control center**
 1. Create R2 bucket origin for the CDN.
 2. Enable public access to the R2 bucket with a custom DNS name.
 3. Create response header transform rules.


## [Limitations](#control-center-on-cloudflare)

 1. All [used services](#description) should be owned by the same account.
 2. [Remote backend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/remote) for Terraform is not implemented yet and state will be stored locally.

 Run **1 control center** may cost ~ **0 $**

 > [!NOTE]
 > Provided costs are very approximate because free tier may not cover a high load for a long period of time.


## [Requirements](#control-center-on-cloudflare)

 In order to proceed with this deployment, we need
 1. [Registered Internet domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_registration) added into account or [purchased directly on Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/registrar/get-started/register-domain/).
 2. Linux host with [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) installed.
 3. Cloudflare [API token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) with the following access permissions
    ```
    Account - <specific account>
      Workers R2 Storage - Edit
      Account Settings   - Read

    Zone - <specific zone>
      Transform Rules - Edit
    ```


## [Deployment](#control-center-on-cloudflare)

 1. Get Terraform code from GitHub repository
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/p2p-way/p2p-agent-infra

    cd p2p-agent-infra/terraform/cloudflare
    ```

 2. Configure input data for deployment in *variables.auto.tfvars* file
    ```shell
    vi variables.auto.tfvars
    ```
    - `account_name` - should be set when user has a ccess to multple Cloudflare accounts
    - `domain_name` - is the zone name you would like to use for control center
    - `cc_prefix` - set a custom prefix to not rely on a generated one
    - `cc_name` - transform rule name
    - `cc_commands` - commands returned by control center

 3. Authenticate on Cloudflare
    ```shell
    export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="<api token>"
    ```

 4. Run Terraform
    ```shell
    # Initialize
    terraform init

    # View execution plan
    terraform plan

    # Apply changes
    terraform apply
    ```

 After some period of time, DNS name will be assigned to the bucket and control center will be ready to use.


## [Cleanup](#control-center-on-cloudflare)

 In order to cleanup all created resources we should use the following steps
 1. Cleanup resources created by Terraform
    ```shell
    terraform destroy
    ```


## [Known issues](#control-center-on-cloudflare)

 1. We can't deploy more than one control center per zone using current approach
    - [cloudflare_ruleset not working #5247](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare/issues/5247)
    - ['zone' is not a valid value for kind because exceeded maximum number of â”‚ zone rulesets for phase http_ratelimit (20217) #3444](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare/issues/3444)

 2. It was observed, that sometimes DNS name assignment take some time and control center migth not be ready after Terraform run.
