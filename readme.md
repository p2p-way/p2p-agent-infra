# Peer-to-peer agent

 To spread information in the World, it might be required to use or prepare a basic [IT infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_infrastructure).

 In case of the [Classical web platforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model) it can be a [web server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server), specialised [web hosting service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_hosting_service) or a [storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_storage) with [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network).

 In case of the P2P shared content, we can use third party platforms or run own nodes, which gives a full control over configuration and management.

 For P2P, we might consider to run nodes for initial content distribution
 1. [IPFS](ansible/readme.md)
 2. [Radicle](ansible/readme.md)
 3. [TON](ansible/readme.md)
 4. [Torrent](ansible/readme.md)


 Please check [Architecture](architecture.md) for more details.
